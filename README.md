# Breakout
This is my own recreated version of breakout for the Atari with OpenGL and C++

Credit goes to Ben Cook on some sections because I used code from his Modern 3D OpenGL tutorial on Udemy.

In order to run the code you will need:
glew
glfw
glm

The only bug in the game is that the ball sometimes disappears randomly. You can press R to make it spawn in the middle again.
