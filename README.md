# Breakout
This is my own recreated version of breakout for the Atari with OpenGL and C++

Credit goes to Ben Cook on some sections because I used code from his Modern 3D OpenGL tutorial on Udemy.

In order to run the code you will need:
glew
glfw
glm

Use a and d on your keyboard to move your paddle.
